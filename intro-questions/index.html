        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Max Jack. I am a rising junior, majoring in Communication Design and minoring in Business of the Arts.</p>
        <p>2. I am taking this class because I have always been interested learning about coding, but have never really had a chance to learn it in a context that would be practical for what I want to do.</p>
        <p>3. I have no experience with HTML, CSS, or JS.</p>
        <p>4. In this class, I hope to gain a fundamental understanding of what goes into creating and designing a website.</p>
        <p>5. On the screen, I have to keep in mind that people can be viewing websites on phones, tablets, computers, and tvs. Digital designs have to accomodate for that, rather than just designing a poster for a standardized size.</p>
        <p>6. https://www.behance.net Behance uses a very intuitive layout to show off art from tons of different creators. Its sleek design isn't overwhelming, and allows individuals' art to take center-stage.</p>
        <p>7. https://www.youtube.com Youtube immediately focusses me on content, and places different videos based off what I've watched in key areas of the page so that I see them and then interact with them. </p>
        <p>8. https://www.warhammer-community.com This website overall is very accessable and interactive. This website has a ton of elements built within it, but manages to deliver them without feeling crowded.</p>
