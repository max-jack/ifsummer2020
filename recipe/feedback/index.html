            <h3>What I Think Works Well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Symmetry. I think that my page is overall very symmetrical at all scales.</li>
                <li>Scaling. I think my page scales well for the most part, without any major problems. </li>
                <li>Hierarchy. I think my page has a very clear visual hierarchy, with the recipe being the center of attention. I also think I effectively seperated my content, while still making it clear that different sections are connected.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What I Think Needs Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Background. The background image is very vibrant, but I struggled to change its opacity.</li>
                <li>Footer. I forgot to style the link at the bottom, and the letter weight is also a little thicker than it should be. </li>
                <li>Simplicity. The reciple itself is a small one, so I need to find more creative ways to style the page without overpowering the information. </li>
                <li>Interaction. I think I could add interest by including hover actions or whatnot to elements like the picture of the smoothie and the link at the bottom. </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div>

                </h2>
                <h3>Things That Need Work</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Background. Its vibrancy and detail overloads the page.</li>
                    <li>Caption. The recipe caption needs more breathing room from the bottom of its block.</li>
                    <li>Hr is too thin. Making it thicker would add clarity and seperation. The seperator itself might be unnecessary. The background blocks behind the text are clear on their own. </li>
                    <li>Color. Add more color in the blocks themselves. Perhaps a yellow from the background image. Yellow could also align with the theme more.</li>
                    <li>Turn the blocks into banners. Adding a sculpted edge to the bottom would easily styalize the page without adding more potentially distracting content. </li>
                    <li>On instructions, the word "smooth" needs to be pushed over. Currently, it is below the rest of its instruction, which is inconsistent.</li>
                    <li>Footer gets too close to the edges at lower scales.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </main>
        <footer> 
        </footer>
